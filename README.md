### Across Vault Word Count

To function properly, this snippet requires MetaEdit.

A key feature of this snippet is the use of metadata fields, in this case inline dataview fields, as variables inside of dataviewjs. Through the use of MetaEdit and elements, an inline value can be used as a variable that stores its state with the page. Additionally, the dataview table can be exported to inline fields to store the data on the page.

Features:
- Search by tag or modified date
- Output: number of pages, modified date, page links, words, total words, characters, total characters, sentences, total sentences

Known Bugs:
- Upon changing search type to tags, all pages cannot be chosen unless another option is chosen first.
